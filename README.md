## Usage

First, open nvim(make sure you have installed!).

Then use the command `:help config` to view the location of the configuration file corresponding to your system.

If you want to change the location of the configuration, for Windows systems, you can add two environment variables as follows:

```
XDG_CONFIG_HOME  D:\Program Files\Neovim\config
XDG_DATA_HOME    D:\Program Files\Neovim\config
```

Now, create fold `nvim` under `config`, enter the `nvim`, run command:

```
git clone https://github.com/pengbin2367/pengbin.nvim.git
```

Finally, open nvim and it will automatically download plugins.

Wait for it to download and reopen it!
